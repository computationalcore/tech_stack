# React Native Tech Stack Project

This repository contains my implementation of the Tech Stack app. This is a study project of the
Udemy's [The Complete React Native and Redux Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course).
Tech Stack is a react native app that shows an animated list of some javascript libraries and their descriptions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

### Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't
have any installed on your system.

* npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js,
you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

* Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.  [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
